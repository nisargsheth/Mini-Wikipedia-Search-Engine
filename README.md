# Wikipedia Search Engine
## Introduction
This project consists of a scalable and efficient search engine on Wikipedia pages.
This constitutes two stages - **inverted index creation** and **query search mechanism**, where the scope of performance in the second stage relies heavily on the quality of index built in its preceding stage. Throughout the project, efforts are made to build a system optimized for search time, search efficiency.

## Basic Stages

 - XML Parsing
 - Tokenization
 - Case folding
- Stop words removal
- Stemming / Lemmatization
- Posting list / inverted index creation

This project is divided into 2 Phases. Phase 1 consists of a Minimum Viable Product that is capable of running simple queries on a small corpus of around 300 MBs.
Phase 2 is optimised and is capable of running queries on a huge corpus of **100 GBs.** of plain text data.
